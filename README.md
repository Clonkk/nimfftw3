Nim bindings to the FFTW3 library.

Set of Nim bindings to the excellent FFTW library, to compute Fourier transforms of various kinds.

These bindings were originally generated here : https://github.com/ziotom78/nimfftw3/blob/master/fftw3.nim

This is still a WIP. The goal is to have a high level API compatible with arraymancer.

TODO:
  * add more documentation, unit test as examples.

These bindings are released under a LGPL license. FFTW3 is released under a GPLv2 or above license.
